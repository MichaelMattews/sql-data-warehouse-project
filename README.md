# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project


### Introduction
This project focuses on building a data warehouse and analytics pipeline for an exhibition event that took place over six months (September 5th – February 11th). The dataset includes visitor count, ticket revenue, and demographics, allowing for deep analysis of customer behavior, peak times, and revenue trends.

The project follows industry best practices in data engineering and analytics, using a Bronze, Silver, and Gold layered architecture in SQL Server. This ensures data integrity, transformation efficiency, and insightful reporting. The final output provides valuable business intelligence to event organizers, helping them optimize operations, marketing strategies, and pricing models for future exhibitions.

#### Project Objectives
1. Data Engineering & Architecture
✅ Implement a Bronze-Silver-Gold data warehouse architecture in SQL Server.
✅ Ensure data quality and validation through structured ETL processes.
✅ Design a star schema for analytical queries, with fact and dimension tables.
✅ Automate data ingestion and transformation using SQL stored procedures or Python scripts.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
✅ Analyze visitor demographics to understand audience segmentation.
✅ Identify peak visit hours, days, and weeks to optimize staffing and marketing.
✅ Track ticket sales trends and correlate with visitor influx.
✅ Detect seasonal patterns and anomalies in exhibition attendance.

3. Business Intelligence & Dashboarding
✅ Build an interactive Tableau or Power BI dashboard for real-time insights.
✅ Create key performance indicators (KPIs) such as average daily visitors, revenue per day, and retention rates.
✅ Enable dynamic filtering by date ranges, ticket types, and customer segments.

4. Optimization & Predictive Insights
✅ Develop trend analysis models to forecast visitor numbers.
✅ Optimize pricing strategies based on demand patterns.

5. Documentation & Best Practices
✅ Maintain clean, well-structured SQL scripts with comments.
✅ Follow Git version control for tracking changes in ETL and modeling scripts.
✅ Provide a detailed project report summarizing key insights and recommendations.
